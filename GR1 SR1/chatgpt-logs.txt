I want to check computationally, not on a lab first, that's my question

Got it — you want to check computationally whether your folded protein could respond to light, before doing any wet-lab work. That’s trickier, but doable at a predictive level if you know what to look at. Here’s how people approach it in silico:

1. Key idea

Light sensitivity in proteins comes from a chromophore (small molecule) embedded in the protein pocket. The protein doesn’t “see” light unless:

It binds a chromophore (FMN, retinal, bilin, etc.).

The binding pocket tunes that chromophore’s electronic states.

So computationally, you’re really asking:

Does my protein fold contain (or allow) a chromophore binding site?

What is the predicted absorbance spectrum of the chromophore in that pocket?

Does illumination lead to a stable “active” vs “inactive” state that could couple to polymerase activity?

2. Computational steps you can take
A) Identify / validate chromophore binding

Use docking or structural alignment to see if your protein has a pocket similar to known photoreceptor families.

Tools: PyMOL alignment, AlphaFold models of your sequence vs. known LOV/BLUF/phytochrome/rhodopsin domains.

If your protein is just a polymerase with no chromophore, it won’t detect light unless you graft in a photoreceptor domain.

B) Predict absorption spectrum

Once you have a chromophore in the binding pocket, use quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) or time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) simulations to calculate excitation energies.

Inputs: structure (protein + chromophore), chromophore force field, solvent environment.

Outputs: predicted λmax (peak absorbance), oscillator strengths (intensity), and bandwidth estimates.

Software: ORCA, Gaussian, Q-Chem, or OpenMolcas (QM side); Amber, GROMACS, CHARMM for the MM side.

C) Compare active vs inactive states

Many photoreceptors switch conformation when the chromophore changes electronic/chemical state (cis/trans retinal, flavin photocycle, bilin isomerization).

You can simulate both states:

Optimize geometry of “dark” chromophore state in pocket.

Optimize “lit” state (isomerized/protonated/etc.).

Run MD to see if the protein pocket changes shape.

If the change propagates toward the polymerase active site (e.g. allosteric hinge moves), that’s a computational sign the domain could regulate activity.

D) Extract computational observables

From these simulations you can check:

λmax (predicted) — from QM/MM absorption calculations.

Δλ between variants — mutations around chromophore shift λmax.

Conformational change metrics — RMSD of loops, distances between key residues, or FRET-like distance changes.

Energy difference between dark and lit states — tells if switching is favorable/stable.
