1. First get the protein folded with AlphaFold2, RoseTTAFold
2. Validate the structure with Rosetta Relax,GROMACS, NAMD, OpenMM, SwissSidechain
3. Prepare the chromophore structure (e.g. retinal, flavin)
4. Set the chromophore on the active site (docking) using AutoDock Vina, AutoDock4 Smina, SwissSidechain Docking Server or PyRx
5. Check the orientation, energy, interaticions, pocket fit, consistency with function and energy ranking to validate the correct docking (to make molecular visualization use PyMol, chimeraX, VMD)
6. Predict absorption spectrum of the system, use quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) or time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) simulations, use ORCA, Gaussian, Q-Chem, or OpenMolcas (QM side); Amber, GROMACS, CHARMM for the MM side.
