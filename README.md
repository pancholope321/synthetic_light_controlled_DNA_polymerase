# synthetic_light_controlled_DNA_polymerase
The objective of this repository is to create a theoric DNA polymerase that is controlled by light wave lenght.

By controlling the polymerase with wave lenght we can accelerate and cheapen the process of producing DNA making faster progress in protein design and protein testing, vaccines, genetic treatement, and so on.
