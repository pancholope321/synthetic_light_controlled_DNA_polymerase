# synthetic_light_controlled_DNA_polymerase
The objective of this repository is to create a theoric DNA polymerase that is controlled by light wave lenght.

By controlling the polymerase with wave lenght we can accelerate and cheapen the process of producing DNA making faster progress in protein design and protein testing, vaccines, genetic treatement, and so on.

# General Roadmap

1. Determine how to control the wavelenght that is detected with the protein
2. Determine how to assign function when a wavelenght is detected (movement)
3. Activate a polymerase mechanism to capture an base and then when is no stimuly add the base to a DNA chain

# Specific Roadmap
1. Compare between cones and analize the diference between different detecting wavelenght cones

	a) Check the structure to see obvious differences on the detecting structure
	
	b) If obvious differences see how to parameterize the critical areas (distances and aminoacids not the specific order)
2. Find the parameters that determine the wavelenght that the cone detects

	a) Check with theory and with data if there is an correlation between different parameters and wavelenght detection
	
	b) Resume the important parameters that correlates with the wavelenght detection
3. Study how to design the cones to be reactive to a small wavelenght interval
4. Design 4 cones with not interlapping wavelenght detection intervals
